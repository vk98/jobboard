##How to use the filter
"The filter is set by criteria.yaml in the directory. It is separated in two groups `includesAll` and `includesAny`, as follows 
the first one will filter by all the criterias, while the second one - by any of them.
`# Group 1 filters by all of these (first AND second AND third ...)
includesAll:
     - 'front-end'
     - 'full-stack'


# Group 2 filters additional by any of these (first OR second OR third..)
includesAny:
     - 'front-end'
     - 'c#'`
"
